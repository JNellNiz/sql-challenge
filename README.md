## Pewlett Hackard Employee Research Project

This project aims to use SQL to model data using data engineering techniques, and run analysis to describe and summarize the available data in a meaningful way. This includes listing specific attributes of employees, identifying subsets of employees, and determining patterns and trends within the dataset.
